Description - 
The SpartanSellers Campus Marketplace Application is an application that allows UNCG campus students to easily browse, purchase, and sell thier dorm furniture, school supplies, or necessites to other students. The motivation behind this app is to solve the problem that students living on campus face when moving to and from school. There are so many supplies necessary to live and study at university, that it can be daunting to transport all of these items to and from school each year. With the SpartanSellers app, students are able to easily purchasee used dorm and school supplies from other students, and then sell them again when they no longer need them. This app reduces waste and reduces the cost of on-campus living for students and parents. The SpartanSellers Campus Marketplace Application is an application that allows UNCG campus students to easily browse used dorm and school supplies from other students. In addition, SpartanSellers allows buyers to leave reviews for sellers, making sure that students who are frequent users of the application throughout their time at university are held accountable to maintain a professional demeanor when selling their used items. Sellers are able to list items for sale on the site. Sellers are also able to view historic pricing by category for items they post, allowing them to be more informed when pricing their items. In addition, sellers must be approved by the admins before listing their items, and admins must approve each listing before it is live to the site. This application will be a website, that will require students to login with an account that contains thier university information, ensuring that students will be interacting online only with other account-holding students.
