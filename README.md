Description
The SpartanSellers Campus Marketplace Application is an application that allows campus students to easily browse, purchase, and sell thier dorm furniture, school supplies, or necessites to other students. The motivation behind this app is to solve the problem that students living on campus face when moving to and from school. There are so many supplies necessary to live and study at university, that it can be daunting to transport all of these items to and from school each year. With the SpartanSellers app, students are able to easily purchasee used dorm and school supplies from other students, and then sell them again when they no longer need them. This app reduces waste and reduces the cost of on-campus living for students and parents. In addition, SpartanSellers allows buyers to leave reviews for sellers, making sure that students who are frequent users of the application throughout their time at university are held accountable to maintain a professional demeanor when selling their used items. In addition, sellers must be approved by the admins before listing their items. This application will be a website, that will require students to login with an account that contains thier university information, ensuring that students will be interacting online only with other account-holding students.
